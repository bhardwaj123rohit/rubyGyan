Introduction to Rspec

Behaviour Driven Development is an Agile development process that comprises aspects of Acceptance Test Driven Planning, Domain Driven Design and Test Driven Development. RSpec is a BDD tool aimed at TDD in the context of BDD.

You could say that RSpec is what is traditionally known as a unit testing framework, but we prefer to describe it as “a Domain Specific Language for describing the expected behaviour of a system with executable examples.”


describe User do
end

The describe method creates an instance of Behaviour. So “describe User” is really saying “describe the behaviour of the User class”.

> spec user_spec.rb

 it "should be in any roles assigned to it" do
  end


The it method returns an instance of Example. This is a metaphor for an example of the behaviour that we are describing.




$ spec user_spec.rb --format specdoc

The specdoc format outputs the name of each Behaviour (the object created by the describe method) and each Example (the object created by the it method).
